# Reducing HA Cluster (Active/Standby): Existing Stack with PAYG Licensing

This folder contains the same YAML configuration and schema files as
[GDM v1 via-API, 3nic, PAYG], and a *patched* Python script to reduce an expanded
HA group to contain only the two new VEs.

[GDM v1 via-API, 3nic, PAYG]: https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-google-gdm-templates/tree/v4.3.0/supported/failover/same-net/via-api/3nic/existing-stack/payg
